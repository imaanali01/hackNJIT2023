## Introduction
DockWeather PRO is a web application developed during the Streamlit.io Hackathon that addresses the critical need for accurate and up-to-date weather and maritime information for dock workers. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for dock workers to access real-time weather data, maritime conditions, and other important information that ensures their safety and the efficiency of their work.

### Background
Dock workers play a crucial role in the global supply chain. They handle the loading and unloading of ships, ensuring that imports and exports move smoothly and efficiently. However, the nature of their work is highly dependent on external conditions, such as weather and sea conditions. Adverse weather can jeopardize both their safety and the timely processing of goods, impacting economies worldwide.

DockWeather PRO was born out of the necessity to empower dock workers with quick, reliable, and accessible information that helps them make informed decisions and ensure the smooth flow of maritime operations.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/) for providing a powerful and user-friendly platform for creating web applications with Python. Streamlit's Python libraries and comprehensive documentation played a crucial role in the development of DockWeather PRO.

Using Streamlit, I was able to experiment with features like creating widgets, which behave as variables within the application. This allowed me to build an intuitive and interactive user interface, even with limited web app development experience.
